## Migrations

- Migrations

  - what do they do?
    - the manipulate the Schema
  - they dont manipulate the database directly because then they can be run in order to assert there are no errors

Migrations are the way the schema is mutated -they provide a simple and repeatable method for manipulation.

Migrations do not directly effect the database instead they modify the schema, and then the differences between the old and the new are calculated and a set of transformation steps are generated. The reason for this split is so that migrations can be executed without affecting the database which allows any errors to be detected without having to....

Migrations are comprised of a type and some data.

- Migrations work to mutate the schema
- They allow multiple developers to work on a single application
- A record of all changes made to the database
- Migrations serve incremental, reversible changes to the schema
- Migrations are stored in files within a folder named migrations located in the root of a skeem project
- This allows for migrations to be transferred between computers

- only stored in files to transfer computers, the ones which get executed are actually stored in the datbase

### Running Migrations

### Database Diffing

After a new schema has been produced for an application, a list of change steps must be realised in order to mutate the existing database. This happens are migrations are run or when the application is initialized. In the latter case the empty schema is used as the old schema.

The first step of this process is to compare the new schema and the old one in order to find what is actually different. Because the models and providers only exist in the abstract, as opposed to the db property which is backed by database tables, only the db of the schema is diffed.

The first step in diffing the dbs is to isolate which tables are new, which have been removed and which have been **potentially** updated. The name field of the table is used to link the old and the new schema. If a name exists in the old schema but not in the new, then the table is marked as deleted. Similarly, if a name exists in the new schema but not the old it is marked as created. If the name exists in both then the table is marked as potentially updated and undergoes a further diff.

For each new table the appropriate `CREATE TABLE` SQL query is generated and appended to a list of all pending database queries. Like wise for each removed table a `DROP TABLE` query is produced and appended to the list.

For each updated table each column

The list of sql commands is then executed. To do this, first, a new transaction is created within the database. This means if an error occurs within the mutate steps the database can be fully restored to prior to the mutations. Without this then the schema could become out of sync with the database. The list of sql statements is the run sequentially. After each step has been executed the schema in the database is replaced by the new schema. Finally, a commit message is sent to Postgres informing it to proceed with the mutations. By updating the schema within the same transaction ensures synchronicity between the tables and the schema.

### Rolling Back

Migrations all have the ability to be reversed.

When a migration is executed it has the option of returning some data. This data will be passed back to the migration when rolling back. This is used, for example, when creating an association the migration will return: the name of the added attribute and the name of the created joining table. With this information the migration is then able to fully undo any effects it had thus restoring the previous schema.

Rolling back is not guaranteed to revert the database completely to its state prior to the migration, instead it simply guarantees the structure of the database will be identical. This is because some migrations such as deleting an attribute are lossy in nature and thus are not purely reversible.

### Storing and Syncing

- migrations are stored in the database along with additional infomation such as whether they have been executed and what data they returned after being executed.
- They are stored in files to allow them to commited to be transfered between system to be run on a different machine
- also gets committed to version control software allowing multiple developers to be working on the same project
