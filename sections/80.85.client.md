## Client {#client_sec}

The client is an interface for the `skeem-server` package and is the system that websites interact with to request and mutate data. Because it is designed to be exposed publicly it does not expose any methods concerning database management

The client is split into two distinct parts. The first is a HTTP server which listens to incoming requests, formats them, and calls through to functions exposed by `skeem-server`. The second is a library which can be used on the front-end of websites which accepts queries and sends requests to the HTTP server.

### Http Server

When initializing the server will create a context object. Then will begin to listen on a port defined in the configuration.

#### Queries

All queries are fired to the same end point with a post request and take the form of a JSON object with `type` and `payload`. The type is used to determine what type of request it is: fetch, mutate, etc. and the payload contains specific information depending on the type.

The endpoint uses a JSON-pure API design. This means, instead of using HTTP status codes to convey errors, all responses are a "200 OK" response and the response data is of a consistent format which holds information pertinent to the error. This means that all requests, no matter their result get returned as a "200 OK" response. Doing this decouples the requests from the HTTP protocol which means Skeem could be transferred to use a different protocol (such as websockets) if desired without much difficulty.

Every request begins with the instantiation of a request object (section \ref{request_object}).

Request bodies are JSON objects which contain two keys: `type` and `data`.

Responses take the form of `{ data: ANYTHING, error: ANYTHING }`.

Any errors throw during processing are caught and converted to be the correct forma If an error is throw during a request it is caught and its contents

Authentication token is in the header.

This end point can also accept requests with multi-part content types. In this case the request data is expected to contain one or more file objects and a single JSON field under the alias of "body". If this field is not present

#### File retrieval

The server provides a dedicated endpoint used to retrieve files and is found at `GET /file/:token`. This end point is uses a GET request as it allows an images to be accessed by going to the a static url. This means an `<img />` tag can be rendered with its source set to that url and have the image display.

The token supplied to the end point is used to retrieve a given file, explained in section \ref{ret_file_sec}.

### Front-end Library

The front-end library provides the user with an object called the `client`. This client holds many functions to assist with the use of Skeem and the HTTP server.

There are several variations of the client each specializing in different environments. The most basic of which is called the "dumb" client. This client provides the most basic wrappers around the different requests. It includes functions to `fetch`, `mutate`, `login`, `logout` and `me`. Each of these accept a query and forward it directly to the server. This client is not designed to be directly used and is instead used by the other variants to prevent them having to re-implement basic functionality.

The "web" client is designed to be used on website. It provides access to the same basic methods defined in the dumb client with some additions to make using it as easy as possible. The first addition is that it automatically manages the session token. When a call to login is made, the client will capture the returned token and store it in localStorage. Then upon reloading, the client will check for the existence of the token and then send it upon all future requests.
