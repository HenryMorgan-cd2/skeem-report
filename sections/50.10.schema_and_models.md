## The Schema

The schema is the central part of all of Skeems functionality. It is used to derive the database structure, covering everything from the tables to the columns, indexes and triggers as well as used to formulate a query interface.

## Models

Models define the actual data to be stored; they are similar in purpose to tables in a database. They also define a set of permissions determining who can access given records.

### attributes

If models are the tables in a database, then attributes are the columns. They each have an identifying name and define a specific data type to store.

There are many built-in attribute types designed to cover all common use cases of data storage. The built-in attributes include:

\begin{multicols}{4}
\begin{itemize}
\item string
\item number
\item boolean
\item date
\item associations
\item passwords
\item files
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

Each attribute type has a set of configuration options to tailor how it functions. For instance, booleans can set their default value, numbers can be declared to be an integer, or strings may enforce uniqueness. This configuration may also be related to validation. For example, strings can declare that they must be present, and numbers can specify a minimum and a maximum value.

One key feature of Skeem is its ability to request trees of data; this is the purpose of the association attribute. Association attributes define relationships between records.

### Scopes

Scopes define subsets of data like published articles, popular products, banned users. They are constructed from a series of discrete operations which ultimately produce a single boolean value.

There are many built-in operators which provide range from straightforward processes such as `eq` for equivalence or `lt` for less than, up to complex ones such as `attr` which will query for the value of a specified attribute.

```{.json caption="A filter using the 'eq', 'attr', and 'value' operators to filter only records whose name equals 'some text'"}
{
  "filter": {
    "eq": [
      { "attr": "name" },
      { "value": "some text" }
    ]
  }
}
```
There are many operations provided by Skeem, which can be composed to create a large variety of filters covering many use cases. The following is a list of all built-in operators:

\begin{multicols}{3}
\begin{itemize}
\item eq
\item lt
\item lte
\item gt
\item gte
\item in
\item path
\item empty
\item anyIn
\item not
\item and
\item or
\item attr
\item value
\item param
\item session
\item id
\item now
\item like
\item ids
\item query
\item scope
\item associationEquals

\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

### Migrations

Migrations perform mutations of the schema, defining specific changes to be carried out, such as creating a model or renaming an attribute.

Migrations present a way to quickly make changes to the schema in a repeatable and reversible fashion. This is essential when building an application, as there are usually separate environments for development and production. Migrations, act as a record of changes, by performing the migrations again it allows for reconstructing a schema.

When executing a migration, it may store some additional data about what was changed. This data allows for the reversal of the execution.
