## Requests

Skeems uses JSON to send requests and receive responses. This allows requests to be much more easily santized against maliscious attempts to manipulate the database in an undesirable way. In other words it helps prevent SQL injection like attacks.

> SQL injection is a code injection technique in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into normally safe SQL by having unsanitized input inserted into the query. SQL injection is a major security vulnerability [@sql_injection].

Due to this sanitization ability queries are safe to execute on the front end and so eliminates the tight coupling between ......
This solves the tight coupling with disperate code issues between the standard client-server model.

All requests are fired to the same end point with a post request and take the form of a JSON object with `type` and `payload`. The type is used to determine what type of request it is: fetch, mutate, etc. and the payload contains specific information depending on the type.

### Fetching Data

Fetching data involves pulling data from the models in a structured fashion. A fetch query specifies a single root model name as the key to the query object. The value then specifies exactly what data you want to retrieve, how to filter and sort it and whether you want to split it into pages.

A fetch response will always be an array of records, where each record will contain its own id as well as any additional attributes you requested. In some cases you may also retrieve the total record count see the section [Pagination](#pagination).

#### Attributes

Attributes specify what data you want to receive for each record. Attributes take the form of an array where each element is a string being the name of the attribute you are requesting, or an object with a name property and a value of the attribute. This object notation is required for specifying additional configuration such as formatting information like an alternative name for results.

Attributes can be aliased by specifying the `as` property

```{.javascript caption='This query will return all articles each containing the article’s id, name, and body. The body will be aliased under the name "text"'}
{
  articles: {
    attributes: ["name", { name: "body", as: "text" }]
  }
}
```

#### Filter

Filters all for specifying specific criteria records must meet for them to be returned.

Filters you a tree of "object functions". This means that each object within a filter operation contains a single key. This key specifies what function you which to execute e.g equality, less that, empty check. And the value acts as the arguments for the given function.

There are many built in filter functions which cover a broad range of use cases

#### Sort

Sorting data is an extremely common and essential ability for data retrieval: Most recent tweets, video length, article title. When sorting data you specify what you want to sort `by` and the `direction` you want to sort: either *asc*ending or *desc*ending.

```{.javascript caption='This query will return all articles ordered by the articles "name" attribute.'}
{
  articles: {
    sort: {
      by: "name",
      direction: "asc"
    }
  }
}
```

You can also specify an array of sorting criteria. Doing this will sort the data initially by the first item, then resolve conflicts with the next item in the list.

\label{pagination}

#### Pagination

Pagination chunks the data into pages.
You don’t want the end user to download 100’000 records, this would be very slow and wasteful.
The returned data will be equivalent to a standard array of records.

```{caption="This query will return the second page of articles where each page holds 30 records." .javascript}
{
  articles: {
    pagination: {
      page: 2,
      perPage: 30,
    }
  }
}
```

##### Record count

As well as the actual records, you also get given a count of the number of records you would have gotten if you did not paginate the data. This is useful when wanting to show end users a list of page numbers and allow them to jump to them arbitrarily.

$$ totalPages = ceiling( totalRecords / perPage ) $$

Retrieving the record count can be disabled by passing the option of `withCount: false` to the pagination block.

### Mutating Data
