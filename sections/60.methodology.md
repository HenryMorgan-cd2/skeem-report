# Methodology

Skeem's use in several projects throughout development (see section \ref{deployment_sec}) meant that there were many times where features were needed, yet Skeem did not offer. This need for fast development meant releases needed to be frequent and priorities dynamic. Therefore, an agile approach was the only realistic way to deliver a product of use.

Development occurred in week long sprints. Over a week, multiple feature requests were received each having an urgency rating. If a feature were urgent, it would be accelerated to be part of the active sprint (sometimes to the detriment of other items if velocity did not allow for the extra work). At the end of the week, Skeem would release a new version and an outline for the next sprint created.

Development undertook a test-driven development approach in order to develop the system in a controlled and effective manner. This approach helped facilitate the quick release cycle that was desired by helping to prevent feature regression. Section \ref{sec_testing} discusses the specifics of writing tests.
