# Methodology

## Development Strategy

When a new feature would be added it would first have high level tests written aimed to test the final functionality of the feature. For instance when first implementing fetching I wrote tests asserting that given a particular query a specific piece of sql was generated. I would then proceed to implement the feature, using the tests as a guide for when the work was complete.

```{caption="Example of what the high level tests would assert (not actual tests)"}
Given: { articles: {} }
Expected: `SELECT "id" FROM "articles"`

Given: { articles: { attributes: ["name"], filter: { eq: [ { attr: 'name' }, {value: 'test'}] } } }
Expected: `SELECT "id", "name" FROM "articles" WHERE "attr" = 'test'`
```

Once all the tests were passing, if there were additional features which either appeared during implementation or that were initially excluded for simplicity, I would add more high level tests asserting the new functionality. I would then proceed to implement these features until the new tests were passing, adding more tests until development was complete.

When the feature was complete, assert by a suite of passing tests I would begin testing the code at a more granular level. I would select functions which were either complicated or hard to test at a high level (maybe code branches for very specific circumstances) and write specific unit tests.

The specifics of how the tests are written are discussed more in the chapter (Testing)[#testing].
