# Methodology

Skeem was used in a number of live projects throughout the course of development (see section \ref{deployment_sec}). This meant that there were many features which were needed which Skeem did not offer. In order to coincide with other development teams it was evident that releases needed to be frequent. Therefore, an agile approach was the only realistic way to deliver a usable product.

Development occurred in week long sprints. Over a week I would receive multiple feature requests and a rating for their urgency. If a feature was urgent I would add it to the current sprint (sometimes having to remove other items if my velocity did not allow for the extra work). At the end of the week I would release a new version of Skeem and create an outline for the tasks to complete over the following sprint.

In order to develop the system in a controlled and effective manner I followed a test driven development approach. This helped facilitate the quick release cycle that was desired by helping to prevent feature regression. The specifics of how the tests were written are discussed in section \ref{sec_testing}.
