# Problem Definition

This chapter will provide an overview of the problems associated with building web applications. It will offer a high level overview of existing practices, how they currently function, why they exist and tje problems that exist which require solving.

There are many issues with this method of building websites.

Websites can be decomposed into many separate yet highly dependant parts:

Database
: a service which allows for the efficient storage and retrieval of large amounts of data.

View
: a system responsible for which templates can be defined and then populated depending on the specifics of a given request.

API
: provides an interface between view layer logic and the database

Authentication systems
: provides methods for confirming a users identity and tracking who is making asking for data in between stateless http requests.

File Hosting
: services which manages the storage and retrieval of large form data such as images. This

This project will attempt to replace the database, api, and authentication and file hosting subsystems with a single unified system.

## API Repetition

Consistent and discoverable APIs tend to lead to very repetitive code. If, for example, you need an end point to fetch a list of blogs and you also need one to fetch all the products. What is really different about these routes? The table name in the SQL query and the columns it returns. This duplication of code leads to highly duplicated code, something which is almost always undesirable [@duplicate_code](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=457502&seqNum=5).

## API Duplication

There is also a trade off to be made between receiving unnecessary data and have many very similar endpoints. For instance, imagine having an end point requesting a list of blog posts. On the site you wist to display the title of each blog along with a some preview text and the authors name. On the same website you also have a page for viewing an individual blog. This page contains a blogs title, body, its authors name, and a posted date. Here, both pages request very similar data, only differing in one pages need for the posted date. The options here are to either have two very similar end points which return near identical data, or forcing the end user to download the posted at information when they may never actually need to render it. The former leads to having to maintain two distinct APIs where as the latter uses unnecessary data. Neither option is desirable.

## Storage vs Display

Databases should store normalizes data which, simply speaking, means storing data in flat tables i.e one for articles, one for authors, one for comments and then you storing relational information between different records. Storing data in the fashion is desirable as it greatly removes data duplication which makes updating records easier and removes the risk of desyncing data by ony updating it in a single location.

The issue with this, however, is that data is not displayed like this to the end user. The end user is not presented with a page containing an article and is required to navigate to a separate page displaying the authors name then have to navigate to a third place to read a list of comments. Rather the end user will be presented with a single page containing all the data amalgamated in an easily digestible and pleasant format. The data the user sees can be envisioned as a tree of data: the root being the article itself and then containing a connected nodes for each comment each having further nodes containing their authors.

The need to request a tree of data from a database is an extremely common and useful thing, however, despite being conceptually simple it can get incredibly complex even when having to traverse only a few levels deep.

## Tight Coupling

<!--
- Tight coupling of DB <=> API and API <=> Views.
 -->

APIs tend to be closely related to the underlying database storing the data. If you have a properties table, then you will want a properties API to access the data. If you were to change the name of a column within the database then you would have to remember to update the API to match and this problem grows if you have tables which span multiple APIs.

There is a similar relationship between the client and the API. When an attribute is changed on the API then everywhere using that attribute is required to update simultaneously else risk displaying incorrect responses or worse, completely crash if vital data is changed.

Tight coupling and disparate implementations leads allows for the opportunity for a de-sync which will inevitably lead to bugs.

## Authentication

<!--

Authentication is a very simple concept in the abstract but is very easy to get wrong.

## Boilerplate

Another issue with the existing method is there is a lot of boiler plate to be setup before a project can be started. You have to set up a system to manage database connections, handle database migrations, seeding data, api routing, authentication, etc. Although some of these systems may already be abstracted and so involve minimal amounts of setup and configuration it is still files which are present and visible within a project. This bloat has a few major drawbacks.

Firstly, it can be overwhelming for new entrants to the system to be faced with so many different entwined parts. Secondly, since it is code openly available to be changed within the repository there is the chance that someone unintentionally changes something and inadvertently breaks the system.

Having a large amount of boiler plate also makes it more challenging when starting a new project. This is because when starting something new you either duplicate an existing application and start stripping out unwanted features. Alternatively, you start from scratch and keep adding all the parts until everything is setup. The first can lead to unnecessary code being left in and the latter can take time to implement. Both can requires some knowledge of how the systems work and both delay the start of the task actually wanting to be achieved.

## Bespoke Knowledge

- Lots of bespoke knowledge from many domains means it is hard to train people

## Data consistency

once you have the data it is important to keep it from being stale.

- Once you retrieve the data from a data source (server) it is important to keep that up to date
- if it gets updated on the server it should be reflected on the client

Although this is not a problem exclusive to SPAs and instead more broadly to websites in general, it is emphasied by SPAs as since they do not need to reload between upon navigation they can potentially cache data more aggressively further improving performance and responsiveness. The risk of stale data, however, greatly limits this potential.
