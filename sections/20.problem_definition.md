# Problem Definition

This chapter will provide an overview of the problems associated with building web applications. It will offer a high-level overview of existing practices, how they currently function, why they exist, and the problems that exist which require solving.

## API Design

APIs tend not to be broken up by resource, not by page. In other words, they would tend to have an endpoint for retrieving blogs and another for retrieving comments as opposed to a single one for handling the "blogs page". This divide is done to allow for requesting only the necessary data. If for some reason, the javascript wants to render an article without its comments, then it should not be forced to receive download the comment data. Good API design is a tricky task, and many issues present themselves when creating one.

### Code Repetition

Consistency across an API means that two endpoints behave in a predictably similar manner. This is an excellent advantage as it means a developer can apply the knowledge they learn from using one endpoint, to all other endpoints on the system. If they can logically predict new functionality, then the API is also very discoverable.

Consistent and discoverable APIs tend to lead to very repetitive code. Given an endpoint fetching blogs and another for products, then what is different about these routes? The table name in the SQL query and the columns it returns. The formatting of the request and the response is likely (or should be for consistency) the same, which can lead to duplicated of code - something that is almost always undesirable [@duplicate_code].

### Data Duplication

Imagine a blog. On the site, there is a list of teasers, each displaying the post title, the author's name and some preview text. There is also a separate page for reading a post, which contains the title, body, author, and the creation date. Here, both pages require very similar data, only differing in the creation date.

When creating an API for this website, there are two options available: either have two very similar endpoints which return near identical data or force the end user to download the additional information when they may never actually view it. The former leads to having to maintain two distinct APIs, whereas the latter is wasteful. Neither option is desirable; a trade-off is required.

## Storage vs Display

Databases should store normalises data which, directly speaking, this means storing data in flat tables, i.e. one for articles, one for authors, one for comments and then storing additional information to relate different records. Storing data in the fashion is desirable as it helps to remove data duplication, which in turn, makes updating records easier and limits the risk of desyncing data by only updating it in a single location.

This structure is fine for storing data; however, the issue is that applications do not display data in this format. The end user is not presented with a page containing merely an article's text and then a separate page holding the author's name and a further page for a list of comments. Instead, there is a single page containing all the data amalgamated in an easily digestible and pleasant format. The data the user sees can be thought of as a tree of data: the root being the article itself and then containing connected nodes for each comment each having further nodes containing their authors.

Requiring a tree of data from a database is a widespread and useful thing; however, despite being conceptually simple, it can get incredibly complex even when having to traverse only a few levels deep.

## API and View separation

The SPA architecture has a sharp divide between the view code and the API code. I.e. code which is responsible for making the requests is very separate from that rendering the views, up to the point where they could quite possibly exist in different languages. This separation presents multiple issues.

### Tight Coupling

<!--
- Tight coupling of DB <=> API and API <=> Views.
 -->

APIs tend to be closely related to the underlying database storing the data. Having a properties table likely means there is a properties API to access the data. Changing the name of a database column would result in an update the API. If the API is left unmatched, then, interactions become more difficult to reasons about, and more of the system must be thought about at a single time to complete particular tasks. Is it "name" or "title", "body" or "description", "createdAt" of "created_at"? This problem only worsens as the system grows and time goes on.

There is a similar coupling between the client and the API. When an attribute is changed on the API then everywhere using that attribute is required to update simultaneously else risk displaying incorrect responses or worse, completely crash.

Tight coupling and removed implementations create the need for constant synchronisation or else will inevitably lead to bugs.

### Cognitive complexity

Defining the data in one location with its use being in another can make it very difficult to discern what is going on and what data is available. It can make it very easy for mistakes regarding the data's structure to occur.

Having to understand the data flow across so many levels, through so many systems can make it very difficult to fully understand where something is coming from and why specific effects happen.

This additional cognitive load can easily make simple tasks appear complicated, often slowing development. Additionally, It can create a high barrier to entry, making it very hard to teach new people how the system works.

### Bespoke Knowledge

Similar to the problem of cognitive complexity: understanding data flows which span many domains leads to the requirement of a high level of underlying knowledge. Being is especially true if the domains span languages.

For instance, given a typical PHP server, when adding a new feature it is likely you would need to understand: SQL to query the data, PHP to perform the database query and format the response, javascript to perform the API request, and HTML to render the view.

This need for so much knowledge about so many domains raises the base level of skill needed to perform many tasks, which makes it challenging to introduce new people to the system. You could have people specialise in particular fields, but this brings rise to further issues by then requiring attention from multiple team members to perform sometimes conceptually simple tasks.

## Boilerplate

Another issue with the existing methods is the need for a lot of boilerplate to be set up before a project before making progress with the actual application. You have to set up a system to manage database connections, handle database migrations, seeding data, API routing, authentication, file management, code compilation, etc. Although some of these systems may already be abstracted and so involve minimal amounts of setup and configuration, their configuration is still present within a project. This bloat has a few significant drawbacks.

Firstly, it can be overwhelming for new entrants to the system to discover what they can and cannot change. Secondly, since it is code openly available to be changed within the repository, there is the chance that someone unintentionally changes something and inadvertently breaks the system.

Having a large amount of boilerplate also makes it more challenging when starting a new project. Either an existing application is duplicated and unwanted features removed. Or it is started from scratch and parts are added all the parts until functional. The first can lead to the unnecessary code remaining, and the latter can take time to implement. Both, however, require knowledge of how the systems work (leading back to the issue of bespoke knowledge) and delay the start of the actual task.

## Authentication

Authentication is the process of ensuring that a request is being made by the person for whom it claims to be. It is not an issue specific to an API and is actually present on all applications with a user system.

This task is abstractly simple but can be very easy to make a mistake when implementing, and the cost of making such a mistake could be extremely costly.

## File Management

Many websites will, at some point, have the ability for users to upload files in some form, be it a profile picture, a product listing or a blog hero. File uploads tend to require a very different request format than that of a typical request - usually taking the form of, what is known as, a multipart request. A multipart request combines multiple types of data into a single request, for instance, an image and a JSON object [@multipart_data].

Creating a consistent APIs structure through endpoints which except this style of request can be difficult. There are two real solutions: forgo consistency and discoverability and accept a bespoke endpoint or allow all requests to be multipart requests even when only JSON is required. Multipart requests have the downside of being relatively user-hostile to read, and browsers tend to provide less capable developer tools for viewing them as they are expected to contain binary data, this makes the latter solution undesirable. Consistency and discoverability, as mentioned, can be valuable traits of an API, so their sacrifice is unideal. Neither solution is ideal, so a trade-off must be made.
