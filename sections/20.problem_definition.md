# Problem Definition

This chapter will provide an overview of the problems associated with building web applications. It will provide a high level overview of existing practices, how they currently function, why they exist and why they are problems which require solving.

There are many issues with this method of building websites.

## API Repetition

Consistent and discoverable APIs tend to lead to very repetitive code. If, for example, you need an end point to fetch a list of blogs and you also need one to fetch all the products. What is really different about these routes? The table name in the sql and the attributes it returns. This duplication of code leads to more code. More code equals more bugs.

- Duplication of requests. Imagine having an end point requesting a list of blog posts. On the site you wist to display the title of each blog with a short extract from the body to act as a teaser. On this teaser you also want to display the authors name. You may also have a author page showing information about the author. This leads to an issue of either having two end points which return very similar data or reusing the end point but then forcing the end user to download more information then they actually require.

## Storage vs Display

Databases should store normalizes data which, simply speaking means so structure data in flat tables i.e one for articles, one for authors, one for comments and then you store relational information on the tables. E.g a column on the comments table referencing a specific article and an author field on the article link it to the correct user. This is to remove duplication and allows database systems to cache and index data which is the reason databases can be so performant even over enormous numbers of data.

The issue with this, however, is that data is not displayed like this to the end user. The end user is not presented with a page containing an article and is required to navigate to a separate page displaying the authors name then have to navigate to a third place to read a list of comments. Rather the end user will be presented with a single page containing all the data amalgamated in an easily digestible and pleasant format. The data the user sees can be envisioned as a tree of data: the root being the article itself and then containing a connected nodes for each comment each having further nodes containing their authors.

The need to request a tree of data from a database is an extremely common and useful thing, however, despite being conceptually simple it can get incredibly complex even when having to traverse only a few levels deep.

## Tight Coupling

<!--
- Tight coupling of DB <=> API and API <=> Views.
 -->

APIs tend to be closely related to the underlying database storing the data. If you have a properties table, then you will want a properties API to access the data. If you were to change the name of a column within the database then you would have to remember to update the API to match and this problem grows if you have tables which span multiple APIs.

There is a similar relationship between the client and the API. When an attribute is changed on the API then everywhere using that attribute is required to update simultaneously else risk displaying incorrect responses or worse, completely crash if vital data is changed.

Tight coupling and disparate implementations leads allows for the opportunity for a de-sync which will inevitably lead to bugs.

## Authentication

<!--
- Authentication is simple but easy to get wrong
 -->

Authentication is a very simple concept in the abstract but is very easy to get wrong.

## Lots of boilerplate

<!--
- Very repetitive infrastructure. Annoying to fix issues as you often have to update many sites.
- Lots of boiler plate
-->

Another issue is that there is a lot of boiler plate

- Slow to set all these systems up

## Bespoke Knowledge

- Lots of bespoke knowledge from many domains means it is hard to train people

## Data consistency

once you have the data it is important to keep it from being stale.

- Once you retrieve the data from a data source (server) it is important to keep that up to date
- if it gets updated on the server it should be reflected on the client

Although this is not a problem exclusive to SPAs and instead more broadly to websites in general, it is emphasied by SPAs as since they do not need to reload between upon navigation they can potentially cache data more aggressively further improving performance and responsiveness. The risk of stale data, however, greatly limits this potential.
