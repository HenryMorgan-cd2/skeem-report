## Fetches {#fetches_sec}

All fetch requests perform a single database query independently of how complex the request is. The query also returns data in the correct format and requires no post-processing.

Fetches start by performing some basic type assertions about the incoming request. The request is checked to be an object with a single key. This key is ensured to be a valid model name, and the value is an object with some subset of the keys: filter, attributes, sort, pagination. If there are any additional keys, the request is deemed to be erroneous. If any of these checks fail, then a malformed request error is thrown containing additional information explaining the exact issue.

```{.javascript caption="A malformed request and the corrosponding response"}
REQUEST:
{ articles: {},  comments: {} }

RESPONSE:
{ error: { type: 'malformedRequest', data: 'multiple models passed to fetch query, only one allowed.' }
```

Parsing a fetch request starts with the instantiation of a class named `SelectQuery`. This instance holds all the information about the final query to be executed, such as what columns should be selected, the "where" conditions, and the "limit". Each step in processing the request gets given this object and has to gets to any relevant data needed to formulate the desired response.

The `SelectQuery` object has an execute function which, upon receiving a database connection,  returns the result of the query.

### Permissions

The first step in processing the query is to find and apply the appropriate permissions for the given model. Section \ref{permissions_sec} covers the process of how these permissions are discovered and processed.

### Filter

Next, the filter part of the query is processed. This filter comprises not only the supplied filter but also permission computed from the previous step.

The filters are simply an instance of an operation tree. Section \ref{compiling_operators} details their compilation.

The result of compiling the filters is an SQL string and a predicted type. If the type is deemed to be `never`, i.e. there would be no results, then the request is aborted, returning the empty result set. This optimization allows for processing many requests without the need to touch the database at all.

If the type is anything else, then the SQL string is appended to the `where` attribute of the query object.

### Attributes

Attributes define the data to returned for each record and are compiled immediately after processing the filter.  Specifying no attributes results in only the id is returned.

Attributes take the form of an array (this is asserted by a type check) this array contains either strings or objects. If an element is a string, then it is inflated becoming `{ name: "the string value" }`. This creates an array of object each with a name property. The name property on the attributes relates to directly to an attribute on the model. This is looked up, and an error is thrown if the attribute is not found. The attributes `get` method is then called allowing attributes to control what it means to retrieve the data fully.

```{.javascript caption="The algorithm used to parse the attributes part of a fetch query"}
for each attribute query in the array
  if the attribute query is a string then
    inflate it to become { name: "attribute query string value" }
  end

  from the selected model, find the attribute with the matching name.

  if the attribute exists then
    call the attributes get method
  else
    throw an unknown attribute type error
  end if
end for
```

Details about how each different attribute type works to produce its SQL is described in section \ref{attributes_sec}.

### Sorting

Sorting controls the order in which the result records appear. Firstly, the sort query is checked to be an array, if it is not then a new array is created and the sort query is set as its only element. Each element of this array is now type checked, ensuring each is an object containing a `direction` (either **asc**ending or **desc**ending) and a `by` value (can be anything and will be checked momentarily). If either of these is missing, or the direction is an invalid value, then a `malformedRequest` error is thrown.

If the `by` value is a string, then, the attribute is loaded from the model (throwing an error is missing). Then the attributes `sort` method is called, which produces the adds the necessary SQL to the query object. If the attribute type does not define a `sort` method, an error is thrown stating that it is an unsortable attribute, this is the case for file and association attributes.

The `by` value may be an object with a key of association. The `by` value contains the name of an association attribute and an `attribute` property. In this instance, the query will be sorted by the given attribute value for the given association.

```{.json caption="Using the sort queries association feature to order results by their author's rating."}
{
  "by": {
    "association": "author",
    "attribute": "rating"
  },
  "direction": "asc"
}
```

Sorting can also be done using the sum of an association's attribute. Sorting by this method involves passing an object with the key of `sum` as the `by` value. This sum object contains the association attribute name and the name of an attribute on the given association. Which then behaves similarly to sorting by an association attribute; however, in this instance, the association must be a "has many" association. An optional `filter` property can be supplied to specify what records precisely to sum of the association.

### Pagination

Finally, pagination is applied - the simplest of all the steps. Like the other steps, the pagination part of the request is type checked to be an object with the keys of `perPage`, `page`, and an optional key of `withCount`. `page` and `perPage` are numbers and the `withCount` a boolean.

The query limit is then set to be the value of `perPage`, and an offset is calculated from `page` and `perPage` and applied. If the `withCount` option is excluded or set to true, then a flag is set on the query to include the count in the final result. This flag is discussed in more depth in the following chapter on SQL Generation.

$$ offset = (page - 1) * perPage $$

### SQL Generation

After processing is complete, the query object must be transformed into SQL. The SQL is built up of a combination of the various elements supplied to the query by the previous step. This process is relatively simple as the previous steps provided trusted SQL into the query. This means no type checking nor sanitization needs to be performed.

```{.SQL caption="Example logic within the SqlQuery to create the final SQL"}
SELECT {columns specified joined by ","}
FROM {table name}
WHERE {conditions specified joined by " AND "}
ORDER {orders joined by ", "}
LIMIT {limit}
OFFSET {offset}
```

This SQL string will return all the correct data. However, it would not be in the proper format. So before executing the query, a new select query is generated for which the from value is equal to the previously generated SQL. This query then selects a JSON aggregation of all the results. This means the final result will be a single JSON object that can be returned directly.

```{.SQL caption="Wrapping the SQL in another query to format the results"}
SELECT json_agg("results")
FROM ({the generated SQL}) "results"
```

#### The withCount flag

If the `withCount` flag is specified, then a slightly different process is conducted for aggregating the results. In this instance we wrap the generated SQL in the same aggregation query, but treat this as the input to the `skeem-format_results_as_object_with_count` function (described in section \ref{database_functions}).

Then, generating an entirely new query following from the supplied data, this time only processing the `from` and the `where` clauses, the select, order, limit, and offset are ignored. The select of the query is set to `count(*)`. This query will return the total number of records and forms the second argument of the final function.

```{.SQL caption="Generated query if the withCount flag is present."}
SELECT "skeem-format_results_as_object_with_count"(
  {the generated SQL},
  {the generated counting SQL}
) as "results"
```
