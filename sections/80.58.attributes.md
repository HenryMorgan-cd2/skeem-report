## Attributes {#attributes_sec}

Each attribute on a model is made up of three properties: name, type, and data.

Each attributes' name must be a string, unique within a model, and comprised only of letters, underscores, and hyphens. They are also not permitted to start with the prefix of "skeem-".

There are multiple attribute handlers, each with their own definition of what it means to "set" the attribute or "get" the attribute. The `type` property refers to which handler the attribute should use.

The `data` property acts as configuration for the attribute handler. It allows the handler to store configuration data. For instance, many attributes store specific validation information.

Skeem comes with a handful of built-in attribute handlers covering all common scenarios. There is also the support to create custom attributes via Skeems plugin system which is described fully in section \ref{plugins}.

### Attribute Interface

Each attribute handler fulfills a implements a specific interface to allowing other parts of skeem to interact with them generically. This interface is comprised of four functions.

#### Get

The first is the `get` function. This function is responsible for returning the SQL required to retrieve the attributes value. There is no pre-conceived notion of what a "value" is, only that this function will return it. This function is most commonly called when processing a fetch request. It is this function that is called for every attribute listed in the request. Implementing this function is optional for a handler, excluding it simply means the attribute cannot be read.

The `get` function is passed:

- the context (see section \ref{context_object})
- the schema
- the model
- the attributes name
- an optional alias indicating what the SQL value should be called
- the attributes data
- an instance of the `SqlQuery` class (see section \ref{fetches_sec} for details)
- configuration for the attributes request

#### Set

Secondly, is the `set` function. This, as the name suggests, is responsible for setting the value of the attribute. It is called during a mutation request. This like, `get` is not required to be implemented, and will simply throw an error if a mutation is attempted.

The function is passed:

- the context
- schema,
- model,
- database changes object (see section \ref{mutation_sec})
- database changes record
- the attributes data
- the new value for the attribute

#### Sort

The sort function allows attributes to define what it means to be sorted. It is called when processing the sort term in a fetch query. Like with `get` and `set` this function is optional, and will simply prevent sorting by the attribute.

It is passed:

- The schema
- model
- an instance of the `SqlQuery` class (see section \ref{fetches_sec} for details).
- the data of the attribute
- the direction of the sort, either `asc` or `desc`

#### Migrate

Finally, the migrate function is responsible for mutating the schema, when being created, updated, or removed. Typically, attributes, will create a single column in the database which stores its value. This function can optionally return data to be stored as part of the migrations downData and will be passed back to the migrate function upon further migrations. This function has to be implemented, else the handler is deemed invalid.

This function is passed:

- schema
- model
- the table for the model
- name of the attribute
- the attributes data
- the down data of its previous migration

### Strings

The string attribute handles the storage text. When migrating string attributes will create a single column in the database of which the name will match that of the attribute.

Postgres offers multiple column types designed for handling strings, char, varchar, or text. Skeem elects to store all strings using the text type `text` data type. All the text types are stored using the same underlying data structure and therefore have the exact same storage requirements, the only difference between them is the number of cycles used to calculate their lengths. This loss of speed in this specific use case is an acceptable compromise in favour of simplicity.

All string fields are not nullable and will always default to an empty string. This makes removes many checks which usually occur throughout front-end code which have to check if the field is null before its use. Also when a HTML form field is displayed, its value will always be a string, never null. Therefore by removing their ability to store null you eliminate the difference between fields which were once tied to an input and those which were not.

When creating a string a default value can be declared in its configuration. This default value indicates what the string should be initialized to when a record is created and no value presented. This default does not take effect if the string value is updated to be empty. It is set as a database level constraint for the column and will therefore take effect automatically when a record is created.

Strings accept the `required` validation. This means that the string must contain a non-empty value before a record can be created. It also prevents the value being set to an empty string. This option makes no changes at a database level, instead it is purely enforced within the `set` method.

They also can be declared to be `unique`. Doing this creates a database constraint for the selected attribute, enforcing that no two records share the same value across the table.

Finally, strings have two configuration options regarding their casing. If a string as marked as `caseInsensitive` then the unique index will be instructed to ignore the case (useful for fields such as email). If the `preserveCase` flag is set to false, then all strings will be converted to lower case when being set. This also causes the get method to lower case any retrieved strings to allow this option to apply retroactively.

The `get` method simply returns the attribute name escaped to be a postgres name. If the `preserveCase` flag is set then it wraps this name in the `lower` function, causing the string to be converted to lower case.

The `set` function first applies the default value (either the one define in the migrations or the empty string) if it is a new record. Next it ensures the new value of the field is a string, throwing an error if it is not. Finally a validation is created, ensuring that the is present assuming that the required validation is active.

When `sorting`, values will always be sorted independent of their casing. This means that strings will actually be alphabetical as opposed to `A, C, b`.

### Numbers

Number attributes can hold any numeric value. They are always backed by a single database column whose name matches the attributes. Numbers fields are nullable, this was necessary as, unlike strings, no logic default exists,

Numbers can accept a default value which will be used to initialize the column when a record is created. This initialization is done at the database level. They can also be marked as required. Doing this removes the nullable status of the column and will cause an error to be thrown if no value is set during creation (provided there is no default value).

Numbers by default are decimal numbers, stored as a `double precision`. This type was chosen as it is the same data type javascript uses for its number type. This means that all use-cases for websites should be covered by this type. Numbers accept an `integer` flag, in this case the column type will be changed to be of type integer, this offers large improvements to operation speed.

When setting, numbers apply their default value and ensure their new value is a number (or integer if necessary). They then ensure the value is present if the required validation flag is true.

### Booleans

Booleans are one of the simplest built in attribute types. They once again have a single column with a matching name and are stored using the `boolean` data type.

They are not nullable and will instead always default to `false`. This is done as it avoids the need to check if something is `false or null` when trying to perform a query. This makes more logical sense for development as you would expect that if you selected all values for which a boolean field was either true of false then you would receive all the records. With `null`, however, this is not the case.

Booleans accepts a flag which will cause them to default to `true` rather then `false`.

The `get` function simply returns SQL retrieving the column, meanwhile the `set` function simply casts the new value to a boolean and assigns it.

When `sorting` all like-values will be grouped together. this means all the `trues` when the direction is ascending all the trues will be last.

### Dates

Date attributes have a single, not nullable, column of using the `timestamp` data type. This data type stores information about both the date and the time, mirroring that of javascript's built in date object.

Dates accepts the required validation, which marks the column as not nullable, and ensures a value is set upon creation.

They also accept a default value to be used as their initialization value. This value can be a string in the format of `2019-05-28T09:05:20.607Z` (this is the ISO 8601 format and is the default value obtained from converting a javascript date object to json). The default can also take the form of `{ now: true }` - the operator function which returns the current date. This allows the date field to default to the current time, useful for storing a created at date for record. This default is enforced on a database level.

The `get` function for dates is trivial, simply retrieving the column directly. The `set` function accepts the same values as the attribute default - either a string in ISO format or an object with a single key of `now`.

### Passwords

Password fields are designed to store a string in a secure manner. They create a single text column to store their data.

They implement the standard required validation and do not implement the `get` or `sort` functions.

When setting a new password the value is automatically salted and hashed. This encryption process uses functions provided by one of postgres' built in extensions, "pgcrypto". This extension includes methods for securely generating random salts, and hashing strings.

The encryption strategy chosen is a blowfish variant as this is the currently recommended strategy. This algorithm is automatically adaptive, meaning that as computing power increases the algorithm can tuned to make computing take longer. The resulting hash holds the information about the used algorithm, this means passwords hashed with different algorithms can co-exist [@pgcrpto](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/pgcrypto.html).

### Associations

Association attributes are one of Skeems must useful assets, their existence allows for extremely complicated operations to be as simple as any other attribute type. They store relationships between two arbitrary models.

#### Migration

The attributes require two pieces of configuration to function: the model to link to, and whether the connection leads to many records of just one.

Traditionally, if one side of a relationship only has a single record (one-to-one or many-to-one), then you would forgo the joining table and store the foreign keys in one of the tables directly. Skeem opts, however, to always have a joining table. This simplifies query generation as it is always identical, it also allows for associations to change to a many relationship without any changes to the database.

The first step taken, when creating an association, is to generate the information for the joining table. This involves three pieces of information:

- The **tableName** specifies the name of the joining table. This is initialized to be `{MODEL_NAME}_{FOREIGN_MODEL_NAME}__{ATTR_NAME}_assoc`. The length of this name is in attempts to prevent duplicate names being generated. After generating the name, it is checked for uniqueness in the database. If the name already exists then it is appended with the string `_2` and the check is performed again, repeating until unique.
- The **ownKey** column holds the id of the main record. It takes the value of `{MODEL_NAME}_id`.
- Finally, the **foreignKey** column holds the id of the record the association is leading to. Its value is initially `{FOREIGN_MODEL_NAME}_id`. If the association is recursive (e.g users have many users) then both the foreignKey and ownKey will be identical, this is resolved by appending `_2` to the foreignKey.

![The tables and keys for an articles to comments association.](images/articles_to_comments_assoc_example.png){height=7cm}

Associations allow for an `inverseOf` property to be specified in the configuration. This indicates to Skeem that the association already exists going in one direction and that this new association is the same relationship but backwards, e.g articles to comments is the inverse of comments to articles. The value of the property will be the name of the attribute on the associated model that holds the information. If this property is given then the tableName, ownKey, and foreignKey is retrieved from the other association and the ownKey and foreignKey and flipped. This means the association will use the same joining table and thus share the same relationships.

These keys are stored along with the association model and the type of association in the attributes data.

The joining table also has three indexes applied to it. Each column gets a foreign key index which ensures their values exist within the other tables. A unique index for a combination of both columns is added to ensure you cannot associate the same two records twice. The joining table is then added to the `schema.db` object.

#### Getting

The `get` function for associations accepts a full fetch request as its request data. The fetch request is processed in the context of the associated model, almost identically to that of a top level fetch request. By having the association use the same processor as the top level helps ensure consistency through out requests.

The only exception is an additional where condition is added. This where condition only accepts records whose id is listed in the joining table.

```{.javascript caption="The where condition responsible for limitting the records to only those associated."}
query.where.push(`
  id IN (
    SELECT {attrSchema.data.foreignKey}
    FROM {attrSchema.data.tableName} innerAssoc
    WHERE
      innerAssoc.{(attrSchema.data.ownKey)}
      =
      {model.tableName}."id")
`)
```

#### Setting

When setting an association attribute, the value passed is an object function (the key being the name of a function, the value being its argument). There are multiple possible functions which can be called to manipulate the association, though they vary depending if the association is a many or a one.

- **Create** is used to create a new record. It accepts the same value as a top level mutate, which will be processed in the context of the associated model. This function also creates a joining row between this new record and the one being modified. In a has many association it will add a new relationship, whereas in a has one it will replace it.

- **Update**, likewise, will update an associated record. If the supplied id is not currently associated with the record then an error is thrown.

- **Destroy** will remove the association and delete the record.

- **Add** is only available for has many associations, it accepts the id of a record and will add it to the list of associated records. This is useful for joining two pre-existing records.

- **Set** is only available for has one associations and is equivalent to the `add` function.
- **Remove** accepts an id of an associated record and will remove the relationship, whilst preserving the record itself - acting as the opposite to `set` or `remove`.

### Images

File attributes store large binary objects. This attribute does not create any columns in the database and exists only abstractly on the model.

These attributes have a single piece of configuration where by you can state if you wish to store multiple images for the single attribute. In this case all interactions are the same except for receiving and setting arrays of items.

When getting the images, a sub-query is formed to load the tokens and alt strings from the `skeem-files` table. If the attribute is set to deliver multiple images then the results are aggregated into an array.

Setting images involves passing an object function (same format as operators). If the key of this function is `add` or `set` (depending on the `multiple` flag) then an image is will be created and stored. The value of the function references the name of a file present in the request (see section \ref{request_object}). A callback is added to the databases before tasks (section \ref{mutations_before_tasks}) which makes a call to the default file providers store function (section \ref{file_providers}).

### Computed

`Computed` attributes allow for the creation of data which is computed based on other values. For instance, if a user model had a height attribute storing was a number representing centimeters, then you could create a computed attribute which could return the inches value.

This attribute stores a computation in the form of an operator tree. Its `get` function simply consists of parsing this tree. There is also no way, as of yet, to define what it means to set the value.
