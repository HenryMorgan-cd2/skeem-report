## Configuration {#sec_config}

Many aspects of Skeem work off of application-wide configuration, items such as the database connection information, the preferred file provider, or the session's secret key. Many of these configuration options could change depending on the current environment and therefore, cannot reside within the schema.

### Different Environments

Throughout a projects lifetime, it will be run in multiple environments such as development or production. Each environment will likely want its configuration. For instance, when developing an application, it is likely desirable to store files locally for speed and cost reasons, whereas, in production, it is probably wanted to use a cloud storage solution such as AWS.

The configuration for different environments can be declared within the configuration file by nesting all the options within an object and making the key equal to the name of the environment. Skeem looks at the `NODE_ENV` environment variable in order to determine which configuration block should be loaded. `NODE_ENV` is a standard variable throughout the node ecosystem used to determine the current environment.

```{.javascript caption="An example of a config with multiple environments."}
{
  developments: {
    /* development config */
  },
  production: {
    /* production config */
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

There are many settings in Skeem for which the value may not want to be hardcoded. These settings may be because the value is likely to change often, may be different for each developer, or because the value should be kept secret and so would want to avoid being committed into the applications repository. The solution to that is the use of environment variables. Environment variables provide run time configuration options to many programs and are used to solve this issue within Skeem.

To use an environment variable, the value in the configuration is set to `{ $env: 'name of env variable' }`. Skeem searches all values of the configuration for objects in this form and substitutes them for the specified variable, throwing an error if this variable is not defined exist.

To further facilitate the use of these variables, Skeem will automatically search for a file in the application root named ".env". This file should contain key-value pairs. Upon starting, Skeem will automatically load this file and merge the contained variables into the environment before passing the configuration.

```{.javascript caption="Configuration which uses environment variables to avoid exposing critical information"}
{
  database: {
    host: { $env: "DATABASE_HOST" },
    username: { $env: "DATABASE_USERNAME" },
    password: { $env: "DATABASE_PASSWORD" },
  },
}
```
