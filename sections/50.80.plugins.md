## Plugins

APIs are large and complex systems which cover an incredibly broad range of use cases. It would be almost impossible to foresee every use case of Skeem and to allow for every possibility. To cope with this, Skeem can augment functionality by way of plugins.

Skeem exposes four of the critical systems to the plugin system: attributes, session providers, operators and file handlers. All the built-in components for each of these categories, use the plugin system itself, i.e. they use no internal access to operate â€” the built-in's ability to use the plugin system demonstrates the options which are available for external plugins.

### Custom attributes

There are many different types of datum which may want to use which do not fit within the bounds of the built-in types. By writing custom attributes, there is the option to work with custom data types.

### Custom operation functions

Web applications filter data in a myriad of different and obscure ways. While Skeem contains a lot of built-in operations designed to cover a wide variety of use-cases, it is implausible that they cover every possible desire.

Therefore, like with attributes, Skeem provides the ability to create custom operation functions and have them integrate seamlessly with those provided.

### Custom session providers

There are many other ways in which users may want to authenticate. Skeem, therefore, allows for the creation of additional OAuth providers. By creating new providers, users could log in with services such as Github and Twitter.

### Custom file providers

Files are stored in a magnitude of different ways and although storing on the local file system and AWS may cover most scenarios, files stored on an FTP server, for instance, is not an impossibility. As functions can be written to store and retrieve a file,  then Skeem can use it to handle files.
