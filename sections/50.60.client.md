## The Client

In order to facilitate the use of Skeem, a library is provided which contain functions for interacting with Skeem from the client. This includes functions to perform fetches and mutations. These functions provide basic type checking on requests to ensure that the format is correct, they also preprocess the response from the server to ensure consistency.

The client also presents functions to facilitate Oauth authentication. The library will perform all the necessary requests to fetch the security tokens before redirecting the user to the relevant 3rd party portal. A response will be listed for automatically and upon receiving it, the server will get notified and the user authenticated. This means adding a full authentication flow to an application involves calling a single function.
