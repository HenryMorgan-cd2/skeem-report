creating a website

---

modern websites must be dynamic and interactive - this is achieved by SPAs

SPAs or single-page applications are a growing trend on the web unlike traditional architectures where each page is a separate resource with its own end-point, its own template and its own request, SPAs combine all the pages into a single end point. When a user navigates to a page they download a large javascript bundle which has the ability to construct any page of the website. The javascript is reads the url the user requested and renders the creates the appropriate views. This means that when a user navigates to another page, the javascript can intercept this and simply render new content without a network request creating a much more responsive interaction.

> :note This is a simplified example of how SPAs tend to work. In reality having a user download the entire code bundle would not be ideal, especially on slower networks. Therefore optimizations are performed such as code splitting where the user only downloads the necessary code to build the requested page and any assets needed to display loading screens, then during idle time or upon navigation download any missing code required to render new pages.

Websites currently are made up of many separate but highly dependant parts:

Database
: a service which allows for the efficient storage and retrieval of large amounts of data.

View
: a system responsible for which templates can be defined and then populated depending on the specifics of a given request.

API
: provides an interface between view layer logic and the database

Authentication system
: provides methods for confirming a users identity and tracking who is making asking for data in between stateless http requests.

This project will attempt to replace the database, api, and authentication subsystems with a single unified system.
