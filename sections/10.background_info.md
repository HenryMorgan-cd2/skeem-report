# Background Information

This chapter will cover how websites currently handle dynamic data on web applications. To understand it, I will briefly cover the architecture of both traditional websites and more recent SPA based websites.

## Traditional Architecture

Traditional architectures treat each page of a site as a separate resource, each having a dedicated end-point, template, and own request. When a user navigates to a page, they will send a request to the server. The server will then look at the details of the request including what page are they requesting and who is making the request, before constructing the page in full, complete with styles and content. This process can involve the server making multiple database requests in order to retrieve all the needed information. Finally, the server sends the completed HTML document back to the client for it to be displayed.

This approach is relatively straightforward; the server is aware of all the assets that make up the page and therefore knows precisely what data it is needed. The server has direct access to the database, which allows it to query for all the data needed. When the user navigates to a new page, this process is repeated, building a new page from scratch.

This pattern has some disadvantages. Many pages on a website look very similar, for instance, two different articles on a news site likely both consist of the same header, footer and sidebar. When navigating to a different article, the user still has to download all of these assets. This problem is most significant on devices with slow connection speeds such as mobiles.

Another issue is that responses are always identical independent to the device sending the request. On mobile, a site may not display a sidebar which is otherwise present on desktop computers. This sending of this unnecessary information can cause slower responses, which once again is most prevalent on mobile devices.

> :note This specific issue can be alleviated by the use of a dedicated mobile website, though this creates many other issues, such as having to duplicate and maintain lots of functionality which is common between platforms.

## SPAs

SPAs (single page applications) solve these issues by moving the page rendering to the client. When a user first goes to the site, they download a single javascript bundle which contains the information to render any page of the site. The javascript then, looking at the current URL, constructs the page to be rendered and displays it to the user.

When a user navigates to a different page, the javascript will intercept the request and construct the new view and render this instead. Since the javascript is in full control of rendering, it has the option to look at the current device specifications and render precisely the needed content - it does not need to render elements which will not be displayed. Additionally, this method means that when a user navigates, they can get instant feedback; whether it is the new content or a loading screen. Either way, the result will be a more responsive interaction.

SPAs, however, provide a new challenge - how does the dynamic content of the page get retrieved. Previously the server knew what page the user requested and could access the database directly to retrieve necessary data. The solution to this problem is with the introduction of a new sub-system into the website's architecture: the API.

The API is similar to the traditional website's server, it accepts requests performs database queries and returns data. However, instead of returning HTML it returns raw data usually in the form of XML or JSON.
