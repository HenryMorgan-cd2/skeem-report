# Background information

modern websites must be dynamic and interactive - this is achieved by SPAs

SPAs or single-page applications are a growing trend on the web unlike traditional architectures where each page is a separate resource with its own end-point, its own template and its own request, SPAs combine all the pages into a single end point. When a user navigates to a page they download a large javascript bundle which has the ability to construct any page of the website. The javascript is reads the url the user requested and renders the creates the appropriate views. This means that when a user navigates to another page, the javascript can intercept this and simply render new content without a network request creating a much more responsive interaction.

> :note This is a simplified example of how SPAs tend to work. In reality having a user download the entire code bundle would not be ideal, especially on slower networks. Therefore optimizations are performed such as code splitting where the user only downloads the necessary code to build the requested page and any assets needed to display loading screens, then during idle time or upon navigation download any missing code required to render new pages.

In traditional websites this is HTML which is compiled on the server before being sent to the client for the browser to render. With the growing rate of mobile usage users have come to expect more interactivness for applications, websites included. Therefore, it is not feasible to construct
: a system responsible for which templates can be defined and then populated depending on the specifics of a given request.

## Website Architecture

Websites are comprised of many subsystems which work in tandem to deliver the final user experience. The number of different subsystem that could exist in the realm of all possible websites is extremely large, for the purposes of this project we shall be focusing on the following parts:

### Database

A database is a service designed to store, retrieve and manipulate large amounts of persistent data. Any website that presents more then simply static pages to the end user is nearly guaranteed to to utilize a database.

### View

The view of the website is what the user sees and interacts with. The view ultimately is HTML which is rendered in the browser but the way the HTML is realised is done in a number of different manners.

### API

An API provides an interface between view layer and the database.

### Authentication systems

An authentication systems acts to confirm a users identity between stateless http requests. They are ultimately responsible for ensuring requests made can be trusted.

### File Hosting

: services which manages the storage and retrieval of large form data such as images. This service could simply store files on the host server, but more commonly these files are sent to a third party CDN (content delivery network) such as Amazon Web Serives. This is done in the interest of speed, reliabilty and expandibility.
