# Testing {#sec_testing}

Testing is an essential part of any software project especially those providing some critical functionality to users - Skeem is no exception.

When writing tests I always took the philosophy of testing functionality not implementation i.e write tests for what something should do rather then how something should be done. Bugs are not usually found by looking at the code, but rather by running the system and getting unexpected behavior. This means that tests should be written independently of the code.

This methodology, although go for the majority of cases, does fall short for some functions. Mostly incases where there are a high number of branching paths. In these cases it can be very hard to cover every possible outcome that can occur. To solve this issue, smaller more targeted tests are written, sometimes covering just singular functions. This makes the testing very fragile, however. If you wanted to change part of the implementation then you may have to update many tests at the same time. Therefore, this approach is used only when necessary.

Each test consists of a description detailing what the test is about and a function to be executed. This function will perform some actions within the system and then make assertions about the results. These assertions can be anything from testing that the return is a string, ensuring a specific error was thrown, or making sure a particular function was called in the process. If all of these assertions are successful then the test passes.

## Test Driven Development

When a new feature is to be added, I would first plan out what the final interactions with it would be. This usually involved defining the API for the feature and creating use cases demonstrating it. I would then solidify these design choices by writing tests asserting the API was correct and the use cases passed - these tests would obviously fail as the underlying system did not exist. I would with the actual implementation of the feature, using the tests as a guide for determining when the work was complete.

Once all the tests were passing I would analyze the code and find paths which did were not tested. I would then write more granular tests focussing on these parts specifically.

```{caption="Example of what the high level tests would assert during the development of fetch queries."}
Given: { articles: {} }
Expected: `SELECT "id" FROM "articles"`

Given: { articles: { attributes: ["name"], filter: { eq: [ { attr: 'name' }, {value: 'test'}] } } }
Expected: `SELECT "id", "name" FROM "articles" WHERE "attr" = 'test'`
```

## Continuous Integration

Continuous integration (CI) is the process of automatically running build and test scripts when changes are made to version controlled code [@ci]. Due to Skeem being used in production it was imperative that the testing was run constantly. By using CI methods I was able to ensure that Skeems code base could always be relied upon and that progress was always made without breaking pre-existing features.

## Code Climate

Code climate is a tool which performs static analysis on codebases and provides feedback about any potential issues found. This issues include:

- Cognitive complexity: how complicated is the code to understand.
- File and function length: does the file or function contain too many lines
- Duplication: are large parts of the code duplicated in multiple places

At the time of writing, Skeems codebase contains 94 code issues, mostly concerning the length of certain functions, and 28 issues about duplication. Some of these duplication concerns, however, are not overly relevant as Skeem is broken up into multiple sub-packages and Code Climate does not take this into consideration.

It also provides metrics such as how much of the code is actually run when performing the tests (i.e code coverage). Code coverage is a useful metric for determining what parts of the system have not been tested. It allows testing efforts to be focused on code that actually requires attention. At the time of writing Skeem testing covers 49% of all the lines in the codebase.
