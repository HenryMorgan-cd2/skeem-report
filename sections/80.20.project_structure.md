## Project Structure

Due to the size of the skeem code base (pushing 12'000 lines) and the range of environments it runs on (server and the client). It was essential to split up the project into logical parts. However I did not want to fully isolate each section due to the tight coupling of the interactions e.g if the format of the fetch response changes then you have to update the server code to handle this new change as well as the client code to keep the format consistent from a developers point of view. Due to this I structured the code as a monorepo.

> "A monorepo is a software development strategy where code for many projects are stored in the same repository" [@monorepo_definition].

Then using a tool named Lerna I was able to manage the projects simultaneously. Lerna automatically resolves the dependency order so, for instance, when you attempt to build the project it knows that A depends on B which depends on C and therefore wait for A to build before moving on to B then finishing with C.

Skeem is broken up into 7 packages, 5 directly related packages, each prefixed with "skeem-", specific to skeem and 2 auxilary packages which were extracted and can provide useful functionallity independently:

### skeem-server

This package contains the majority of the logic, it contains the implemention for processing requests, creating a database, session authentication, migration creating and validation, etc...

The `skeem-server` package is split into two, confusingly named, parts: a manager and a server. The manager contains the all the functionallity of the app, it controls loading the schema, producing and executing SQL, updating config, etc. The server simply listens for http requests sent from the client, performs basic format type checking and then calls manager functions in order to create a response.

#### Server

#### Manager

### skeem-cil

This implements a command line interface for interacting with skeem, it implements no fundamental logic and instead acts a wrapper around the server.

### skeem-gui

Similar to the CLI, the gui acts a wrapper around the server functionality and displays the information in a visual application.

### skeem-client

Provides functionallity for a client

### skeem-common

Holds common functionallity needed between packages, such as error messages

### es-qu-el

provides helper functions to generate and sanitize SQL statements

### Typer

Typer standardies type checking accross the app.

### overseer

declarative CLI generator used to power Skeems CLI.
