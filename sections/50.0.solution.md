# Solution

In order to solve the problem I have created a system named Skeem. This chapter acts as a high level overview to Skeems functionality, and how it is to be used.

Skeem wraps a standard object relational database but augments its functionality by providing a new query interface which is easily sanitizeable and so can be executed directly from the client side. This greatly helps to decouple the API and View layers and the view can directly query for its relevant information. This new query interfaces is designed around tree data structures and so meshes nicely with the needs of the view layer. Skeem fully manages this underlying database and the user is not required to understand how it is layed out or utilized nor do they require any knowledge of SQL to utilize Skeem.

Skeem also provides a full authentication system capable of identifying and tracking users as well as being able limit their access to resources as necessary.

> :comment Skeem requires no code. no training required.

Skeem can be fully setup, configured and maintained without the need to write any code. Instead it is managed through either the command line or through a graphical interface. These interfaces provide instant feedback of any errors that occur when changing things and also provide help information to aid Skeems usage. This helps to solve the issue of training. There are of course still intricacies with using various sub-systems which will require additional help, however, to solve this issue skeem contains a fully set of documentation detailing many aspects.

> :comment runs a server constantly listening to http requests

Skeem runs as a service and communication is done via http using a pure json API. This allows browsers to easily communicate with it as all ship with the ability to serialize and parse json data as well as send http requests.

> :comment websockets for live updates

Skeem exposes update events through web sockets to enable clients to automatically fetch data when it beomces stale. This allows data to be more aggressivley cached and the interactiveness of sites increased.
