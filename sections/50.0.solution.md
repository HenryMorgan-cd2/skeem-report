# Solution

This chapter will start with an overview of what Skeem is and why it is useful. Then each part of the system will be discussed in more depth, highlighting what the part does and its usages. This chapter will not cover exactly how the system works or the reasoning behind decisions, this will be done in the chapter on implementation.

## What is Skeem

Skeem compiles the database, API, authentication, and file hosting sub-systems into a single system under a unified interface.

Skeem is a very opinionated system; it makes assumptions about how data will want to be stored, how users should authenticate, what operations will want performing. These decisions closely follow current best practices and how, most typically, websites use data.

 Developers make a declaration of what data they want to store. The system will then automatically create a database tailored to this specific information needed, including optimizations, such as adding indexes, to selected columns to allow for efficient retrieval of data.

Skeem provides a bespoke query interface specifically designed to fulfil the everyday needs of web applications, including:

- fetching data in tree structures
- authenticating requests
- handling file uploads

Skeem is also agnostic of the exact view technology that is used and provides a client which can run in any javascript environment.

The system can be fully configured and maintained through human-readable interfaces; there is no requirement to write any code. These interfaces can provide instant feedback for any errors that occur and can also provide helpful information aiding in Skeems usage. These interfaces contribute to solving many of the issues concerning training. There are, of course, still intricacies with using the various sub-systems which will require additional help; however, Skeem handles this by providing a full set of documentation detailing many system details.

## Who is Skeem built for

Skeem is designed to be used by web developers. They are expected to be somewhat technically minded but are not required to have any knowledge of how databases work or function, nor do they need to know SQL to any level.

## Value Proposition

Having decisions, concerning database structure, enforced can eliminate much boilerplate from websites as well as reducing the amount of knowledge needed to set up an application. Enforcing how files are stored means no setup is required.

Skeem controls both the structure of the database and the API creating minimal repetition throughout the application. By simply declaring a new attribute will see its availability propagate through all interfaces.

By allowing queries from front-end code, it helps to reduce the problems of cognitive complexity as it is easy to see what data is available at the same time as seeing where it is used. It allows developers to request the exact data that is required; this then eliminates the problems associated with API design.

By including authentication and file management systems within Skeem, they can follow a consistent interface, helping to not only eliminate the need for training and improving discoverability.
