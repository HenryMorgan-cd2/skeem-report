## Schema

- Every application has a single schema
- The schema is responsible for defining all aspects of the site from how and what data is stored to how people can authenticate and what information different people can access

The schema is a single large JSON object which holds infomation concering all aspects of the application.
When an application is first created its schema is initialized to an empty skeleton.

The schema is stored in the database in the table "skeem-schema". This table only ever holds a single row. When the schema is updated the table is cleared and the new schema is inserted.

The schema is serializable.

```{.javascript caption="The empty schema"}
 {
  db: {
    functions: [],
    tables: []
  },
  models: [],
  providers: []
}
```

The schema has three top level keys, db, models, and providers.

`db` holds infomation about the database. This includes a record of all tables including their name, columns indexes, and constraints. It also stores a list of custom defined functions.

`models` stores all the models created within the application.

`providers` holds infomation about the available session providers. Each provider contains a name, its type as well as specific configuration for the given provider type.

### Models

Each model has an assocated table

- Always has an id
