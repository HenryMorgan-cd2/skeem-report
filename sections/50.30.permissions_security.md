## Permissions and Authentication

The client should always be assumed to be malicious, and as queries can be sent directly from the client, it is imperative to be able to ensure their identity and limit their access accordingly.

### Authentication

Before being able to limit user access, the ability to determine who is making the request is required. Skeem provides a couple of ways in which to authenticate someone. The first is with a stored user identifier such as an email address along with a password. The second method is by using an oauth2.0 provider, such as Facebook or Google.

Skeem allows for multiple session providers to be active, allowing sites to present users with multiple options to log in.

### Permissions

With authentication, there are now two distinct user states: authenticated and anonymous. Every model allows for the definition of a filter for each role. These filters are applied to every request, meaning it is possible to declare that while authenticated people can access all articles, anonymous people may only view public ones.

### Roles

Often sites have a clear set of user groups such as admins, authors, sellers, or guests. Skeem allows for the declaration of additional roles. These roles have a name, and also a scope used to determine if a particular user has the role. Users can have multiple roles simultaneously.

The roles, like anonymous and authenticated, can have filters defined on models and will apply themselves to requests in the same fashion.
