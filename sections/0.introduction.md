# Introduction

Websites are becoming more complex and offering increasingly advanced functionality whilst at the same time expected to be more performant for end users. Every non-trivial website is in some part of dynamic data, that is data which can change over the course of an applications life time. This could include anything such as blog posts, user details, editable content, user-tailored suggestions, product listings, delivery statuses. The report details the development of a system aimed to make the retrieval and manipulation of this data trivial.

The report will start by laying the foundation of how dynamic data is handled traditionally and more recently as well as some of the associated issues that arises with these approaches. Then how others have attempted to solve the issues. Next I shall discuss how I created a system aimed at solving the problem, including how the system works and how I built it. Finally I shall discuss how I tested the system as well as the opportunities I have had at deploying the system to re-world deployments.

## Motivation

I have been a web developer for a number of years, over this time being involved with the creation of many web-based applications covering a wide variety of scopes. Over this time the method taken to create theses applications has changed significantly always towards the goal of producing better applications with similar techniques in shorter time-spans. I believe the system I have created furthers this goal.
