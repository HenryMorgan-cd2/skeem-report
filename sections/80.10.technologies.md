## Technologies

Skeem takes advantage of many existing technologies in order to provide its functionality. This section acts as an overview of the key technologies used.

### Typescript

Due to Skeem having to provide functionality to a website, javascript must be used.

Typescript is a superset of javascript which adds typing capabilities to the normally dynamic language [@typescript]. This typing infomation allows compile time code checking which greatly assists improving relaibility of code as it helps to ensure against common trivial bugs. Typescript is transpiled into standard, es5 compliant, javascript meaning it is able to run on all modern browsers. This compatibility is essential because if skeem only supported the latest version of chrome then it would instantly elliminate the possibility of using the system on any standard website which has compatibility as a requirement.

Typescript also aids other developers using the system as the typing infomation is used in most modern IDEs to supply intellisence infomation allow features such as auto completion, inline errors messages, and hints for expected arguments and returns.

### NodeJS

NodeJs is a javascript runtime designed to build scalable network application [@nodejs]. NodeJs was a logical choice as it allowed writing server code also in javascript which allowed consistent interfaces to be constructed. It is also much easier to develop a system when writing in a single language as their is less mental energy exerted to convert from one environment to another.

### Postgres

Postgres is a object-relational database system [@postgres]. Postgres has powerful, inbuilt JSON processing capabilities. It allows for storing JSON objects natively as well as writing queries which inspect the contents of JSON. More importantly Postgres allows for the construction of JSON objects with queries themselves. This makes Postgres a very logical choice when the goal is to create trees of data as the database can pre-format the response greatly reducing the need for much post query processing.

Another feature which postgres offers is an optimizer which can automatically transform subqueries into join statements. This optimzation is greatly taken advantage of in skeem as throughout the code base there is not a single joining statement. Further reasons for this are discussed in the chapter on fetch query sql generation.

Postgres also provides the ability to write custom database functions relatively easily. These functions help to encapsulate complex pieces of reusable logic and are optimized by postgres in order to maintain performant queries. They are used in a number of place throughtout skeem such as to trigger update messages for live syncing and to format responses in certain circumstances.

### Jest

Jest is a testing framework which allows for the creating of automated tests. It provides a simple interface to perform assertions concerning the code and is an essential tool to prevent feature regression on such a large project. Details about how tests were written is detailed in section \ref{sec_testing}.

### Other Libraries and Services

Skeem also takes advantage of a number of prebuilt libraries and services.

NPM
: is the defacto package manager for node [@node], it provides easy hosting and distribution of node packages and is the method skeem uses to manage its publications.

Pusher
: is a web service specialised in providing real-time functionality to applications [@pusherjs]. It provides simple wrappers are web sockets as well as fallbacks to ensure compatibility accross, even outdated, browsers. Skeem uses Pusher send messages to clients in order to enable the live updating capabilities.

Amazon Web Services
: are a cloud computing platform[@aws] which provides relatively affordable file hosting and is integrated into skeems file storage capabilities.
