## Design Patterns

### Object Functions

Object functions define a way to convey function invocations in a serializable format. They take the form a JSON object with a single key. This key is the name of the functions name and the value is the functions argument. This value can take any format and is left to the discretion of the particular function.

Object functions are backed by a selection of handler functions. Each valid key for an object function has a one-to-one correspondence with one of these handler functions.

```{.json caption="The format of an object function"}
{ "name": "value" }
```

This object function pattern is prevalent throughout Skeem including in the values for mutations and the filters for fetches.

### Type Checking

Many aspects of skeem are control from external unsafe sources, such as a clients computer. In these cases it is crucial to perform some form of check to ensure that the incoming data is of the correct format. I have found throughout the project that this type-checking should be left as late as possible.

This forces the code that is about to use the data to perform its own checks, this means that if you wish to change the expected format of something then the code performing the checks is situated directly next to the code using it. This helps with understanding what the data is expected to be and how it is used.
