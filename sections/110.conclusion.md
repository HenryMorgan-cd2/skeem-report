# Conclusion

There is a range of projects using Skeem, including some mobile applications. I believe Skeem to be a very flexible and beneficial system to these companies, helping to simplify their development process. In general, it has been very well received by the developers of these systems.

Now that this project is complete, from a university perspective, development of Skeem will be opened to a handful of other developers who are eager to start work. I am hopeful for Skeem's future as a fundamental tool in aiding the development of exciting systems.
