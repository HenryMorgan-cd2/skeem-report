# Solution

To fix these issues I have created a system:

- runs a server constantly listening to http requests
- built in authentication
- wraps and maintains a database.
- auto generate an API based upon the database thus removing some coupling
- Send queries from the front end
- developed a custom query format
- Trees of data to be fetched and mutated
  - Complex filter operations
  - Pagination, sorting, etc...
  - Unified format to improve api consistency
- Plugin system to allow future features
