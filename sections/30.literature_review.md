# literature review

This chapter shall discuss existing technologies which attempt to solve the outlined problems, including an overview as to how each system functions along with their advantages and limitations.

## GraphQL

GraphQL is a system which takes a declaration of the data within an application and in return, produces an API to make requests for the data [@graphql_2019].

The API allows for defining and requesting logical clusters of data, even if stored across separate tables. Then queries can be constructed to retrieve multiple chunks of data at the same time through defined relationships helping reduce the "storage vs display".

Front-end code constructs these queries, allowing the coupling between the APIs definition and the view layer to be lessened. It also eliminates the API design problems as the API structure is the responsibility of the library.

A disadvantage of GraphQL is its need for the definition of the data structure. This definition can add a lot of boilerplate to an application, with a lot of repetitive declarations. GraphQL also hides a lot of the query logic, making it difficult for new developers to comprehend how requests work.

GraphQL also does not dictate the structure of the database, which has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it means the system is flexible and can be applied retroactively to projects, but on the other, it means a database system still needs to be set up and maintained independently.

## MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database system using a document-based data model [@mongodb_2019]. Unlike traditional databases which organize data in fixed tables with association records to join related data. MongoDB, on the other hand, stores data in arbitrarily nested shapes. Meaning data is stored in a way that more closely aligns itself with how it is presented to the end user, eliminating the "storage vs display" problem.

The ability for storing arbitrary shapes allows for rapid prototyping; however, having no rigid schema does have some disadvantages. Over the life span of an application, it is inevitable that more fields will be needed. Having no strict schema means new records can store these new fields without change, this means, however, there is no guarantee to the fields a record has and is entirely dependent on on the data available at the time of creation. Whereas in a relational database, when creating a new column, all other records must be made to be valid within the new constraints, e.g. adding a column which cant be null, then a default must be set for all prior records.

## Auth0

Auth0 is an external authentication system, which moves the logic needed to authenticate users outside of the application [@auth0_2019]. An API is available which provides commands to registers and authenticate users. They also handle necessary user system tasks such as password resets, offering either email confirmation or text message confirmation.

Auth0 solves the authentication system by moving authentication outside of the application. Doing this ensures the use of strategies which are well-tested and reliable.

It does, however, further add to the level of knowledge required to understand the system. There is also boilerplate needed for the application to connect to Auth0, which is likely identical between apps.

## Gap Analysis

The approach demonstrated GraphQL of allowing queries to be formed and sent directly from the client-side solves many of the outlined coupling issues in an extremely effective manner. GraphQL, with its opinionated API approach, eliminates the issues associated with API design.

Auth0's approach to prescribing what a user is and how they are authenticated adequately eliminates the authentication concerns.

Many systems exist which each solve some combination of the defined problems, and a combination of multiple technologies could solve many of the issues. However, the need to combine multiple technologies, each having independent standards and practises, only serves to exacerbate issues concerning boilerplate and training needs.
