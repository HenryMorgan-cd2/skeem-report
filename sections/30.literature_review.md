# literature review

In this chapter I shall discuss existing technologies which attempt solve the problem with pre-existing technologies. I shall giving an overview as to how each system functions as well as their advantages and limitations.

## GraphQL

GraphQL is a system which takes a declaration of the data your application stores and produces and API to request said data. The API exposes has a single endpoint which can accept queries generated on the front end.

These queries are designed to allow nested data to be retrieved in a simple, and consistent manner. By having the front end directly send queries for the desired data, GraphQL decouples the API from the view layer. It also eliminates the API duplication problem as the front-end can simply request exactly what data is needed without having to declare a new end point.

A disadvantage of GraphQL is its need for the initial setup the data structure. This adds a lot of boiler plate the an application, with a lot of repetitive declarations. GraphQL also hides a lot of the query logic making it difficult for new developers to comprehend how requests actually work.

## MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database system which uses a document based data model. Unlike traditional databases which organize data in fixed tables with association records to join related data, MongoDB stores data in arbitrary nested shapes. This means data can be stored in a way that is more closely aligned with how it will be presented to the end user.

One problem with NoSQL databases is there lack of a rigid schema. Being able to store arbitrary fields without prior declaration means you can develop the application, initially, very fast. However, it means that over time you will likely add more fields, but doing so does not update the old previously created records. This means it can be uncertain when requesting a record what attributes it has exactly. Whereas in a relational database, when you create a new column you are forced to retroactively make all other records valid within the new constraints, e.g if you add a column which cant be null, then you must set a default for all prior records.

## Auth0

Auth0 is an external authentication system. They move the need to authenticate outside of your application and manage the logic on their own systems. They provide an API which gives access to commands to create new users, and log in to accounts. They also handle common user system tasks such as password resets, offering either email confirmation or text message confirmation.

Auth0 solves the authentication system problem by moving authentication outside of your application. Doing this can ensure that the authentication strategies are well-tested and reliable.

It does however add boiler plate to the application by requiring an interface into auth0 which is likely going to be identical between apps. It also means there is yet another bespoke system to learn.

## Conclusion

Many systems exist which each solve some aspect of the defined problems and through a combination of multiple technologies many of the problems could be eliminated. However, the need to combine multiple technologies, each having their own standards and formats, only serves to exacerbate issues concerning boiler plate and training needs.
