## Database Usage

Skeem utilises a single Postgres database in order to store and query for its data. Skeem fully manages this database and is responsible for creating all of its tables and extensions.

### skeem\* Tables

Skeem relies on a handful of predefined database tables in order to function. Their names are prefixed with "skeem", in order to differentiate these tables from application-specific ones. Using this prefix is prohibited for application tables.

skeem-schema
: stores the applications schema

skeem-migrations
: stores a list of all migrations

skeem-sessions
: stores a list of sessions. Each row contains information for the user owning the session, when the session was created, when the last activity occurred and the session provider used for authentication.

skeem-files
: stores references and information for uploaded files

skeem-version
: stores the current database version

### Functions {#database_functions}

Skeem also relies on a few custom functions in order to provide certain features. These functions, like the tables, are all prefixed with "skeem".

The `skeem-array_to_object` function accepts a JSON array as input and outputs an object with the indices becoming keys. The object also has a length property defined. In practise, this function would transform `[1,2,3]` into `{0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3, length: 3}`.

The `skeem-format_results_as_object_with_count` function takes two queries as input, the first returning an array of records and the second returning a count. This function will call the `skeem-array_to_object` function on the results of the first query and add the `recordCount` property being the result of the second query. This functions primary use is to format paginated requests. Specifically, it allows for the `recordCount` variable to be added to the object. Then in javascript, the object's prototype is set to be that of the built-in array, resulting in an object with a `recordCount` property which has all the same functionality as a standard array â€” all constructed within a single database query.

### Upgrading the Database

In order to accommodate new functionality over time, the database will likely have to change; new tables may be required, old tables may need to columns. In order to facilitate this need, Skeem provides a database upgrade mechanism.

This upgrade system works by keeping track of a database version number and a list of steps on how to upgrade from one version to another. When the system starts the current version number is loaded from the database and compared to the highest upgrade number available. If these are equal, the database is up to date, and the system proceeds as normal. If however, they are different, the database goes through the update process.

The update process involves iterating through all upgrade steps, executing each, starting from the current version number counting up until all steps. After each step, the version number is updated to keep it synchronised with the database state allowing for the possibility of an error within the upgrade step.

As of the time of writing, there are six upgrade stages (starting from zero). These stages perform the following:

0. Check to see if the database exists, if it does not then attempt to create it.
1. Install necessary extensions, set up tables, initialise empty schema.
1. Rename tables from "cord-" to "skeem-" (The project underwent a renaming to prevent conflicts with pre-existing systems) and add columns `executed` and `timestamp` to the migrations table.
1. updating the schema format to accommodate some new features.
1. Create response formatting functions to remove inconsistencies of particular edge case requests.
1. Add a `loggedOut` column to the sessions table. Previously sessions were deleted.

When creating a new application, the version number would attempt to be loaded, but this would cause the throwing of an error as no database would exist. After catching the error, the version number is deemed to be -1. This process means that when creating a new application, by only starting the system, a database will be created automatically (as step 0 would execute next). This feature dramatically improves the time required to set up and start using a Skeem application.
