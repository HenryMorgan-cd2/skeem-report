## Documentation

Skeem provides a set of documentation providing guides and examples of how different parts of the system works. This manual is essential to allow other developers to use the system independently, mainly because many of the features use bespoke terminology and practises.

The documentation helps to limit the issue of bespoke knowledge, as described in the problem definition. It provides a single source for developers to find answers and methods for completing particular tasks.
