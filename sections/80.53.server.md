## The Server

Skeems server is a package which holds all the core functionality concerned with managing and Skeem application. Many functions are provided to perform common actions such as running migrations and performing a fetch query.

Skeem then provides different interfaces which expose these helper functions in various mediums.

**CLI** allows for the management of the application from the command line (section \ref{sec_cli}). \newline
**GUI** exposes the functions through a graphical interface (section \ref{sec_gui}). \newline
**Client** exposes key functions designed to be used by the final website in combination with the client (section \ref{client_sec}).

Interfaces such as the CLI are simply wrappers which call these helper functions. This means that both the CLI and GUI do not need to duplicate any logic in themselves and instead focus on conveying the data to the user in the most effective manner.

### The context object {#context_object}

This context object holds all the information pertinent to the current skeem application. This includes the applications configuration, the root folder, connections to the database, and the schema. Many functions throughout skeem require a context object as an argument.

> :note The schema is stored in memory as it is assumed that it will never change during the servers life cycle and therefore caching it can prevent many database requests considering how frequently the schema is loaded.

To create a context object you supply the server with a path. The system then searches recursively upwards from the supplied path looking for a file named `skeem.json`. If this file is not found before the root directory is hit, then an error is thrown stating that no skeem application was found. If the file is found, its location is marked as the root directory and its contents are the configuration object. These two data are then form the basis of the context object.

The context object can also be instantiated by providing the config and root directly. This can be useful when testing the system as it does not require any files to actually exist.

### The request object {#request_object}

The request object is a specialization of the context object. It holds all the same properties and information with the addition of data concerning the specific request. The additional data includes the user who is making the request and their roles. It also, in some cases, holds a reference to files that were uploaded.
