## The Server

The server handles all incoming requests. It checks

Skeems server handles all incoming requests

When the server initializes it first loads reads the schema from the database and stores it in memory. It is assumed that the schema will never change without the server being restarted and therefore it can be loaded in order to avoid querying for it through every request.

- The server hosts
- listens by http
  - so the client can comminucate
- request and reponse formats
  - why pure json
- authentication token

Skeems uses JSON to send requests and receive responses. This allows requests to be much more easily santized against maliscious attempts to manipulate the database in an undesirable way. In other words it helps prevent SQL injection like attacks.

> SQL injection is a code injection technique in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into normally safe SQL by having unsanitized input inserted into the query. SQL injection is a major security vulnerability [@sql_injection].

Due to this sanitization ability queries are safe to execute on the front end and so eliminates the tight coupling between ......
This solves the tight coupling with disperate code issues between the standard client-server model.

All requests are fired to the same end point with a post request and take the form of a JSON object with `type` and `payload`. The type is used to determine what type of request it is: fetch, mutate, etc. and the payload contains specific information depending on the type.
