## The Server

The "skeem-server" package holds all the core functionality concerned with managing and Skeem application. Many functions are provided to perform everyday actions such as running migrations and performing a fetch query.

Skeem then provides different interfaces which expose these helper functions in various mediums.

**CLI** allows for the management of the application from the command line (section \ref{sec_cli}). \newline
**GUI** exposes the functions through a graphical interface (section \ref{sec_gui}). \newline
**Client** exposes key functions designed to be used by the final website in combination with the client (section \ref{client_sec}).

Interfaces such as the CLI are simply wrappers which call these helper functions. Which means neither interface needs to duplicate logic and instead can focus on conveying the data to the user in the most effective manner.

### The context object {#context_object}

This context object holds all the information pertinent to the current Skeem application, including the applications configuration, the root folder, connections to the database, and the schema. Many functions throughout Skeem require a context object as an argument.

> :note The schema is stored in memory as it is assumed that it will never change during the servers life cycle and therefore caching it can prevent many database requests considering how frequently the schema is loaded.

The server provides a function which creates a context object, after supplying a path. The system then searches recursively upwards from the supplied path looking for a file named `skeem.json`, reaching the root directory without finding the file results in throwing an error, stating the absence of a Skeem application.

Upon finding the file, the location and the contents are used to create a context object with the data indicating the root directory and configuration, respectively.

Instantiating a context object can also be done by providing the config and root directly. This method can be useful when testing the system as it does not require any files actually to exist.

### The request object {#request_object}

The request object is a specialization of the context object. It holds all the same properties and information with the addition of data concerning the specific request. The additional data includes the user who is making the request and their roles. It also, in some cases, holds a reference to files that were uploaded.
