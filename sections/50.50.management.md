## Management

The primary method of managing a Skeem application is through a command line interface. The CLI provides many functions which can be used to manage all aspects of a Skeem application.

The CLI includes the command `init`. This command gets supplied a name of an application and will generate all the necessary files and folders needed to create a Skeem application.

Migrations can be created with the `migrationsCreate` and executed by running `migrationsRun`.

The CLI also provides method for viewing information about the current application. The `schema` command will print to standard out the entirety of the current applications schema. This command also can be passed a model name, in which case just the schema related to the model will be printed.
