# Requirements

## High level requirements

- what would need to be achieved to solve all these issues

* Tree Structures
  - Fetch arbitrary tree structures
  - Query interface which is easily sanitizable such that it could be executed from even dangerous clients without risk of returning non-permitted data.
* Simple:
  - Explainable through limited, reasonably sized, help docs
  - Simple GUI interface
  - Requires 0 knowledge of database structures to use associations
  - Includes File management
  - User authentication
* Consistency
  - alert clients to changes in data

## Specification Gathering

In order to create a solution which will alleviate these issues I had to ensure that the system achieved everything needed to replace existing systems rather then just add a further system which must be configured, maintained and learnt.

accessed an in-production data base and pulled a list of all interactions with the database

- used by 4'000 unique visitors a day
- 4% are new visitors
- 20'000 registered users

I went through all interactions with the database and records how it was being used:

- attributes
  - has many through
  - has many through where condition
  - has many with condition
  - has many dependent nullify
- Validations
  - presence
  - uniqueness
  - inclusion
  - number greater than
  - uniqueness in scope of attr: value
  - validate uniqueness in scope with condition unless attribute: value
  - Validates on: :create
  - association.attribute must = value
  - validates [if/unless] attribute: value
- Callbacks
  - before_validation
    - default attribute to another attribute if not present
    - default attributes only on create
    - default attributes to parameterized other attribute
    - default attribute to association attribute
  - before_create
    - self.slug = name.parameterize
  - after_create
    - update association
    - send emails
    - update self
- Scopes
  - where(attr: value)
  - where.not(attr: value)
  - order(attr: :desc)
  - where association count >= 1
  - where association count === 0
  - where association attribute
  - where in associations scope e.g where(tag_id: Tag.published)
  - composing scopes ( adding limits)
- Permissions
  - through user association
  - through user association | where(attr: value)

Using this information I obtained the minimum viable feature set needed

## Technical requirements

combining these two sets of requirements produces the following set: ....

Must be able to cope with any future requirements and not pigeonhole functionality.

- Create Models
  - store basic types strings, number
  - store associations between two models
  - store files
- Fetching
  - attributes
    - Request primitive attributes such as strings, numbers
    - request associations
  - provide a filter to a query
    - request a record given the records id
    - request a record based on its attributes i.e requesting published records
  - sort queries
    - by attributes
    - by associations attributes
  - pagination queries
- Mutations
  - create records
  - Update records
  - delete records
  - add/remove association records
  - upload files
  - validate data
- Sessions
  - Authenticate users
  - Specify users permission to access data
- Consistency
  - Use web sockets to be alerted to updates
- Permissions

  - Specify access (read + write + remove) of users on:
    - records
    - attributes

- Provide a way to change production databases safely

- GUI
  - Provide a way to create a database
  - Provide a way to create a model
  - add/update/remove attributes from models
  - seed data
  - view records for a model
