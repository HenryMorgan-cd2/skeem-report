# Requirements

This chapter will outline what a system would need to do in order to solve all of the discussed issues effectively.

## High-level requirements

The ability to query from the client naturally leads to the system requiring a sense of who is making the request, therefore having a built-in permission system and authentication system is a logical step.

Many websites have sub-systems which have not been discussed or at least some need to perform custom actions which can only execute securely on a server. Therefore, having the system capable of being used from both a client and a server is a necessity as not to create a scenario what having used the system prevents needed functionality.

The handling of files is a very pre-defined task, that is to say, there are an obvious, and very limited, set requirements - files must be able to be uploaded and downloaded. Building the ability to handle files into the system would help to reduce the amount of boiler plate surrounding the system and also would allow for a consistent API to be created.

Like with file management, the uses of a database in the context of web applications is reasonably limited, and so unlike GraphQL, the system could be very opinionated as to the structure and contents of the database. This viewpoint has the added benefit of reducing coupling between the API and DB structures and removes the need to define the structure in two places. Additionally, this would help to limit some specific knowledge needed to manage a database.

A system containing this level of functionality and so opinionated as to be able to remove boilerplate would need documentation to educate people as to what the system does and how exactly each part works.

## Specification Gathering

In order to create a solution which will alleviate these issues, it was essential to create a system fulfilled all database use-cases in order to replace existing systems rather than adding a further system to maintain.

In order to achieve all database requirements, a specification of an actual use case needed gathering. To do this, I obtained access to the database of an in-production application. The application this database was backing had 20'000 registered users and 4'000 unique daily visitors, with 4% of them being new to the site entirely. I, therefore, deemed this database to be substantial enough to cover many use-cases likely to be mat by a website.

I went through the complete source code of this application and collated a list of all interactions with the database. A minimal viable feature set was obtained using this information. Many interactions have not listed as they are relatively trivial examples, such as the ability to store numbers and strings. The following list includes only notable interactions:

- attributes
  - has many records through another association
  - has many based on a condition
  - set a default for an attribute
  - set default values derived from another column
- Validations
  - presence
  - uniqueness
  - inclusion
  - number greater than
  - uniqueness in scope of attr: value
  - validate uniqueness in scope with condition unless attribute: value
  - Validates only when creating
  - validates only if a condition is met
- Callbacks
  - After creating a record
    - perform an update of an association record
    - send an email
    - update own attributes
- Scopes to find records matching the following criteria
  - where attribute equals a set value
  - where attribute does not equals a set value
  - where association count >= 1
  - where association count === 0
  - where association attribute
  - where in associations scope e.g where(tag_id: Tag.published)
  - composing scopes ( adding limits)
- Sort
  - Sort records by given attributes
  - vary the direction of sorting, either ascending or descending
  - sort by the number of records in an association
- Permissions
  - limit access based on an associations value
  - limit access based on an attributes value
