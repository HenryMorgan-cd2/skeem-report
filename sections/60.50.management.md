## Management

There are two predominant methods to managing a skeem application: through the use of a command line interface or via a GUI.

The first step in using skeem is to initialize a project. The easiest way to do this is to use Skeems command line interface (CLI). The CLI has a lot of functionality to help you manage your database and configure your application, see (#CLI). To initialize the project simply run the command `skeem init myProject`. This will create all the necessary files and folders in the current directory for an application named "myProject". The next step would be to create a model.
