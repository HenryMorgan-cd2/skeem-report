## Models

Models are one of the most important aspects of Skeem, they define the data. They control what gets stored and how, as well as how it is accessed and who can access it. They are akin to database tables but not neccessarily one to one.

### Attributes

At attribute is like a database column, it stores a single piece of data for a model. Attributes are comprised of a name, a type and a set of configuration specific the the type chosen.

There are a number of built in attribute types which aim to accomadate any type of data you may want to store. If, however, you have a need to store data which one of the built in types do not support then you Skeem allows for a custom attribute type by the means of a plugin, see the chapter on [attribute plugins][]

### Scopes

Scopes define methods for fetching subsets of data: published articles.
